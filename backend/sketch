GameLoopHelper every 10 sec, creates a boss special attack (which is mass pyroblast). Here the BossAction is created
containing the boss that issued the attack, what targets, which attack.

When the action is processed it does the following for each target:
* Reduces HP, based of the attack dmg
* If the attack has a debuff, add the debuff to the target

This adds the BurningDebuff to the target, which is being processed by BuffHandler. And each tick of the buff, a DotAction is
added to the actionQueue, which contains the target, dmg amount and what buff it is.

When the DotAction is processed by the actionQueue, then it deals the ticking damage
